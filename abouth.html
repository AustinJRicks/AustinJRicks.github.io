	<div class="pageText"><p>This year is KTH campus&apos; 150th anniversary, and now KTH has grown into 5 campuses in Stockholm city and suburbs.</p>
  	<p><b>Description of the motivation</b></p>
    <p>Due to intensively collaborations between the growing campuses KTH, KI, S&ouml;dert&ouml;rn University as well as between the companies based in S&ouml;dert&auml;lje on the south side of Stockholm city leads to increasing emissions due to logistics operations.  Despite that transport operations hardly find people&apos;s attention, the design of campus logistics impacts on health, well-being and the general environment without the lack of every student, faculty members and service providers on daily basis. However, there is little knowledge available regarding the student och employee passenger flows and logistical activities between the main campus and south campuses.</p>
    <p><b>Description the current practices and situations of campus commuting</b></p><p>
	Since the inaugmentation last October, two south campuses, KTH S&ouml;dertalje and KTH Flemingsberg, have been established for the education and research activities. At the moment and now, there is discussion about dedicated minibus connecting south campuses to other campuses. Shuttle bus towards Kista has recently been closed, but we see the potential of the Swedish &apos;godsbussar&apos; concept for passengers and goods delivery. It is therefore valuable to know current demands of travel and delivery, and again look into the possible implementation of the Swedish &apos;godsbussar&apos;.</p><p>
